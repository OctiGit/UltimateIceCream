# Welcome to my Ice Cream project!

This project was made from a course in Ultimate Courses I recently did. Here I learn how to create a React.js app from scratch. The goal here was to learn basic concepts from the library like how to work with JSX, making use of hooks like useState, useRef and useEffect, as well as implementing custom hooks. And of course when is the best time to make use of these hooks, for example, when to make an API call with axios, etc.

I hope you enjoy it as I did! Cheers!
